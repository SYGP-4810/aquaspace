            <h1 style="font-weight: 500;">What you should not put in a fish tank</h1>
            <br>
            <p>If you’re at the stage where you’re ready to set up your fish tank, you’ve probably done a lot of
                research.
                You most likely know what size tank you’ll need, how to set it up, how many fish and which fish species
                you’re going to keep in your tank.
                <br>

                If you’ve bought your fish from a reputable supplier, they will have given you plenty of guidance on how
                to care for your fish and what to include in the tank.
                <br>
                What most people don’t tell their customers though is what not to include in the tank.
                This is just as important, if not more important than knowing what things to include in your tank.
                <br>
                If you unknowingly put certain things into your aquarium, you could very well put them in danger and
                some items can be fatal for fish.
                <br>
                But what are these things?
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2 style="color: black; font-weight: 400;">1. Plastic</h2>
            <p>Many fish shops sell plastic toys, like Nemo or SpongeBob, to include in your tank.

                When plastics are left in water for long periods of time they can release potentially toxic chemicals
                into the water, so they should be avoided in fish tanks at all costs.
                There are a number of exceptions to this if the plastic has been graded food safe. This is often
                displayed with a triangle made up of three arrows.

                However, avoid one-time-use plastics such as water bottles.

                Recent research undertaken on plastic bottles left in cars shows that chemicals can leach if used for a
                prolonged period of time.

                Often the plastic toys you can purchase from fish stores are painted, and the paints may not have been
                sealed. Ensure when you buy plastic toys that you find out whether or not they have been sealed and are
                safe for your aquarium.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2 style="color: black; font-weight: 400;">2. Ceramics</h2>
            <p>Some ceramics are OK to use in your tank – if they are marked as ‘dinnerware safe’ they will usually be
                fine for your tank.

                As a basic rule of thumb with ceramics, if it’s not safe to eat off, don’t put it in your aquarium.

                There are a few exceptions to this rule, for example, we can eat using copper-glazed ceramics, but they
                would be harmful to shrimps, and other species. Always check if there are any substances that are
                harmful to your particular inhabitants.

                There is also evidence to suggest that lead is present in some pottery which is a health hazard for both
                humans and fish alike.</p>
